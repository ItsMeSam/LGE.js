===============
With this Javascript "class" you can make 2D games faster and easier.  
I've created one really simple game, it can be found in the 'example' directory. From that you can make much greater games. With awesome levels, enemies and other things like that! Just take a look at  the source and you'll know exactly how to use it, but you can also learn it by looking at the example directory. Have fun!

More things are coming..
